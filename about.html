            <h1>Hexle</h1>
            <p>A <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/" target="_blank">Wordle</a>-like game where you have to guess the unsigned 16-bit number in hexadecimal! It's an iteration of my previous (less fun) game called <a href="https://jamesl.me/bytle/">Bytle</a>.</a></p>

                <summary>Once I've played today's Hexle, can I play another one?</summary>
                <p>
                    Yes, but you'll need to wait until tommorow to play the next
                    Hexle. It's part of the novelty of Wordle-like games â€” you
                    only get one shot at the game every day.
